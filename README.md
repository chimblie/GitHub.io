Analysis Report
1.	Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this assessment is to help Roza, who is a biological researcher, to create an interactive data visualization for her webpage. In this assignment, Roza wants to identify bacteria species that synthesizes proteins that test like beef. She believes that the ideal bacteria species that makes synthetic beef is found in the humanâ€™s belly button. To test her hypothesis, Roza sampled people across the country to identify bacteria species that colonized the belly button.

2.	Results:
For her webpage, Roza created 3 different charts.
First, Roza created a bar chart that displays the top 10 bacteria cultures found in the belly button per individual. See the image below.

	In the top left side of the chart, we have a section called Test Subject ID NO: with 		a drop-down menu. There, viewers can select any subject ID NO and view	their			demographic information.
Then Roza created a bubble chart that displays the number of bacteria cultures per sample when an individual is selected from the drop-down menu.

And finally, Roza created a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.

This gauge indicates that this individual has a belly button washing frequency of 
              2, meaning that they wash their belly button 2 times per week.

3.	To summarized, Roza was successful in finding the best way to visualize the types of bacteria that colonize humans belly buttons. She was able to create engaging and dynamic charts and identified the best way to share her information with her audience. 
Here is Roza final project.
